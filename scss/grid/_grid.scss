/*********************
IMPLICIT GRID
a sass grid system based on percentages

Although it is called Implicit Grid, it also contains both implicit and explicit column generators.

The col-imp mixin works differently than most grid systems. It requires an inner-wrapper (called inner-wrap) whose width is set larger than the wrapper (wrap) containing it. A wrapper around inner-wrapper is needed to hide the overflow. This hidden extra space allows each element inside the inner-wrap to have a right margin (even the last element!). Hence the imp, sort for implicit. This means you can rearrange these elements and not have to worry about clearing out the right margin on the last element. Whether you're rearranging the order via jQuery, changing elements' column width via media queries, or using js masonry.


mixins avialable:

	wrap
	inner-wrap
	hide-overflow

	last *
	pad *
	inline *
	shift *			- args: $Columns-to-shift: 0 (can be positive or negative)
	fill-left		- args: $Cols-to-Pad: 1
	fill-right	- args: $Cols-to-Pad: 1

	col-imp			- args: $Col-Width of $Parent-Size: $total-cols
	col					- args: $Col-Width of $Parent-Size: $total-cols

	gutter-margin-bottom	- args: $Multiple: 1
	gutter-margin-top		  - args: $Multiple: 1
	gutter-margin-right 
	gutter-margin-left	 

	gutter-padding-bottom	 - args: $Multiple: 1
	gutter-padding-top		 - args: $Multiple: 1
	gutter-padding-right 
	gutter-padding-left

* must be above col-imp or col to work properly
